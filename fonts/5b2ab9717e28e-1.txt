What is your why (what is driving/motivating you to start this business and work with us)?

Background: Its been almost 10 years since I have been working on my company with my partner we are very young at that time and very passsionate about starting a business (digtal agency) and ditch 9 to 5. 

There is only one rule.. not to give up. even local advetising industry wasnt good enough to pay our bills. then we start working online with International clients
started with very basic online jobs like graphic design, presentation design, video animation etc. and building a team. Biggest challenge at that time was money management.

After having money understanding, we started to invest mostly in Realestate/stocks/mutual funds.

 I have created a structure with proper allocation how our earned money should be invested.

But Now everything seems stagnant for me. Thats why I joined mentorbox few months ago and learned a lot.


My Biggest Why: 

I am looking to have meaningful challenges/projects that really change lives especially under privillaged (3rd world countries).

1- through education "Quick Enlightment Project" which is 'highly targeted with language of certain audience'.
